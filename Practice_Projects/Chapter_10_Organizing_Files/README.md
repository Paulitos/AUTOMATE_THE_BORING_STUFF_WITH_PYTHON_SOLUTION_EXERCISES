selective_copy.py copy the files with the specified extension in the destination folder.  
deleting_unneded_files.py only shows / prints in the console the files that are over 100 MB, not delete them.  
The folders with the test cases for each program simulate in the majority of the cases the timeline before the .py programs are executed.
