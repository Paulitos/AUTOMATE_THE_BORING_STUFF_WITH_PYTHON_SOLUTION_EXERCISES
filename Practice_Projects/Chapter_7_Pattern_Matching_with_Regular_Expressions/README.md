## Date Detection
The pattern `r'^(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])/(0[1-9]|1[0-2])/(1000|1[0-9]{3}|2000|20[0-9]{2}|2999)$'` specifies that the day portion should match numbers from 01 to 31 `((0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01]))`, and the month portion should match numbers from 01 to 12 `((0[1-9]|1[0-2]))`.

Since `"32"` is not a valid day in any month, the pattern does not match, and that's why you see None as the result.

If you want to detect and handle cases where the day is out of range for the month, you would need to implement additional logic after the regular expression match
