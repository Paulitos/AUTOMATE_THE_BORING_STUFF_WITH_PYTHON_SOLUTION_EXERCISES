**1. Which of the following are operators, and which are values?**  
\*&nbsp;&nbsp; <- operator  
'hello'&nbsp;&nbsp; <- value  
-88.8&nbsp;&nbsp; <- value  
-&nbsp;&nbsp; <- operator  
/&nbsp;&nbsp; <- operator  
+&nbsp;&nbsp; <- operator  
5&nbsp;&nbsp; <- value  
**2. Which of the following is a variable, and which is a string?**  
spam&nbsp;&nbsp; <- variable  
'spam'&nbsp;&nbsp; <- string  
**3. Name three data types.**  
Integer, floating-point and string.  
**4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?**  
Expressions are made up of values combined with operators. They all evaluate down to a single value.  
**5. This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?**  
In summary, expressions produce values, while statements perform actions or control the program's flow.  
**6. What does the variable bacon contain after the following code runs?**  
bacon = 20  
bacon + 1  
The answer is 20 because that operation is not stored in bacon.  
**7. What should the following two expressions evaluate to?**  
'spam' + 'spamspam'  
'spam' * 3  
The same result, 'spamspamspam'.  
**8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?**  
Because Python does have some naming restrictions, one of them is it can't begin with a number.  
**9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?**  
int(), float() and str().  
**10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?**  
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'  
Because you can't concatenate different data types. You could fix it by removing the 99 or doing str(99) for instance.
