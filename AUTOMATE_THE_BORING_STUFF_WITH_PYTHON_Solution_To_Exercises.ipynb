        "3. `range(0, 10, 1)`:\n",
        "   This is the same as the previous example but explicitly specifies the step value as 1. Since 1 is the default step value, this doesn't change the behavior of the loop. It starts from 0, ends at 10 - 1, and increments by 1 in each iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, all three forms of the `range` function in a `for` loop will produce the same output of iterating over the numbers from 0 to 9 with a step of 1. The difference lies in the syntax used to create the range.  \n",
